# smart_traffic_light_system
This project presents a smart traffic management system for three intersections. It utilizes infrared sensors to detect vehicle presence and absence at each intersection, incrementing and decrementing counts accordingly. Based on the counts, it dynamically adjusts traffic light priorities, ensuring smooth traffic flow.

Components Description:
1. Infrared Sensors (IR): These sensors detect vehicles at each intersection by emitting and receiving infrared radiation.
2. Traffic Light module: Consists of red, yellow, and green LEDs. The code controls these lights to manage traffic flow by dynamically adjusting priorities based on vehicle counts at each intersection.
